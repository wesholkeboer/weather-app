## weather. local.

This app was made as a way to retrieve local weather information based on a user's geolocation. The user can get current local weather information, or navigate to the five day weather tab to get weather forecasts for every three hours for the next five days.

This React app was made with a focus on test-driven development mobile-first responsiveness.

Weather data comes from the OpenWeatherMap APIs:

Current local weather API documentation can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/current

Five day forecast API documentation can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
